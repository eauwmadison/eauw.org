introHTML: >-
  <p>Issues related to the suffering of non-human animals are often absent in discourse related to the most pressing issues currently facing the world. Recognizing the need for education and awareness around these issues, Animal Advocacy UW–Madison is hosting a free fellowship program to equip students with the knowledge to understand the most pressing issues involving animals and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions in this field. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and unique opportunities to work on these issues.</p><p>The fellowship is structured such that you’ll have weekly 90-minute discussions with a cohort of 3–5 participants and one lead facilitator. Before attending each discussion, you’ll spend roughly 1–2 hours completing a set of readings (and sometimes a brief written exercise).</p><p>The Fellowship is currently undergoing minor revisions. For now, check out last year’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iMcRc1mFdJgR2gshaLVqp6zZY2XEoO2eNyqMo4_4Akk/edit?usp=sharing">Fellowship curriculum</a> for a taste of what we have to offer!</p>
