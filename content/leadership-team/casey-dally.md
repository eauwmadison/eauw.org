Casey is a graduate of UW–Madison, where she studied English Linguistics, CS, History, and Japanese. She has been a member of the EA community since Summer 2021 and a leader at EA UW from Spring 2022 to Spring 2023, after which she moved to Japan. She grew up on a farm in rural Wisconsin with vegetarian parents and has actually never eaten meat. She cares deeply about improving the happiness, physical health, and mental health of all sentient species and wants to spend her life working on those issues. She also has prosopagnosia (more commonly known as "face blindness") so although she loves meeting people, she is usually unable to recognize anyone.
