Rory is a senior studying Mathematics and Philosophy. He is especially interested in the use of mathematical and statistical reasoning to solve important problems in the world, and in spreading the general ethos of the EA community to larger society. Outside of EA, he likes to swim regularly, read classical and speculative literature, self-study math, and occasionally write poetry.
