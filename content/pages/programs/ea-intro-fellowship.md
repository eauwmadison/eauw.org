title: Intro to EA Fellowship
priority: 1
applicationLink: https://eauw.org/apply
introHTML: >-
  <p>The Fellowship program was built to equip students with the knowledge to do
  good in the world more effectively and the tools to think critically about
  their career ambitions. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access
  to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and mentored research and
  project groups.</p><p>Each program lasts 7 weeks, and is built around weekly
  1-hour discussions with 3-5 other Fellows in which you’ll talk freely about
  these ideas. The total time commitment is 2 hours per week for 7 weeks.</p>
descriptionHTML: <p>Here’s a week-by-week breakdown of what you'll discuss:</p>
topics:
  - title: 'Week 1: The Effectiveness Mindset '
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>Over the course of Week 1 and 2, we aim to introduce you to the core
      principles of Effective Altruism. This week we’ll investigate what
      opportunities to do good we have available to us, come to terms with the
      tradeoffs we face in our altruistic efforts, and explore tools that can
      help us find unusually high impact opportunities. You'll also get to know
      each other and your facilitator!</p>
  - title: 'Week 2: Differences in Impact'
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>In Week 2 we continue to explore the core principles of Effective
      Altruism. We focus on giving you tools to quantify and evaluate how much
      good an intervention can achieve; introduce expected value reasoning; and
      investigate differences in expected cost-effectiveness between
      interventions.</p>
  - title: 'Week 3: Expanding Our Compassion'
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>During Week 3 we explore who our moral consideration should expand to,
      with a particular focus on farmed animals as a case example. We also use
      the term “Cause X” to ask what opportunities we could be missing.</p>
  - title: 'Week 4: Longtermism'
    contentHTML: >-
      This week we’ll explore a different approach to finding high-impact
      interventions - ‘longtermism’ - which attempts to find interventions that
      beneficially influence the long-run course of humanity. 
  - title: 'Week 5: Existential Risk'
    contentHTML: >-
      This week we’ll cover the definition of an existential risk; examine why
      existential risks might be a moral priority; and explore why existential
      risks are so neglected by society.
  - title: 'Week 6: Emerging Technologies'
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>During this week, we’ll explore a few technological trends which might
      have relevance for existential risk. This week, understandably, can’t
      cover all the major considerations for what the future will be like, but
      we aim to cover two key emerging technologies that might be less well
      known - transformative artificial intelligence and advances in
      biotechnology.</p>
  - title: 'Week 7: What Might We be Missing?'
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>This week, we’ll read and discuss critiques of effective altruism, and
      criticisms of how some people try to implement EA. We are dedicating a
      week to this because, to whatever extent we are wrong, it would be good to
      know. Honestly reckoning with strong counter arguments (from both within
      and outside of the EA community) can help us avoid confirmation bias and
      groupthink, and get us a little closer to identifying the most effective
      ways to do good.</p>
  - title: 'Week 8: Effective Altruism in your Life'
    contentHTML: >-
      <p>This week, instead of a normal fellowship meeting, you’ll be meeting
      individually with the EA-UW team to discuss plans for the future,
      potential careers, and general methods to put into practice what you have
      learned over the fellowship.</p>
