  <p>At EA UW, we run mentored research projects, host impact-oriented career
  advising, attend professional conferences, and much more — but the best way to
  get involved is to join our <a

  Fellowship"><strong>Intro to EA
  Fellowship</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This semester, we won’t be
  running any alternative programming. However, you can feel free to check out
  some of the ones offered by these independent RSOs that share many of EA UW’s
  values.</p>
