  <p>The Fellowship program was built to equip students with the knowledge to do
  good in the world more effectively and the tools to think critically about
  their career ambitions. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access
  to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and mentored research and
  project groups.</p><p>Each program lasts 7 weeks, and is built around weekly
  1-hour discussions with 3-5 other Fellows in which you’ll talk freely about
  these ideas. The total time commitment is 2 hours per week for 7 weeks.</p>
