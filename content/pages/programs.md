  <p>At EA UW, we run mentored research projects, host impact-oriented career
  advising, attend professional conferences, and much more — but the best way to
  get involved is to join our <a
  href="https://eauw.org/programs/ea-intro-fellowship" title="Intro to EA
  Fellowship"><strong>Intro to EA
  Fellowship</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>
  
  <p>Each program lasts 7 weeks, and is built around weekly
  1-hour discussions with 3-5 other Fellows in which you’ll talk freely about
  these ideas. The total time commitment is 2 hours per week for 7 weeks.</p>

  This semester, we won’t be 
  running any alternative programming. However, you can feel free to check out
  some of the ones offered by these independent RSOs that share many of EA UW’s
  values.</p>
